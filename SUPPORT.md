## Project Bugs, Issues and Suggestions

If you encounter a bug or have an idea to improve the project, that's great! Don't hesitate to file an issue. Please understand though that contributors from Stateful often work on their own product roadmaps which means that bugs and feature requests need to get prioritised internally first. Therefor we can't promise to immediately respond nor provide a bug fix to a problem. We encourage everyone to propose a pull request for any kind of bug fix or enhancement to help us maintain the project.
