Reporting Security Issues
=========================

At Stateful we take security seriously. Whether it is the code we write, the software we use or the platform services we provide, security is always extremely important. 

Please do not open an issue or pull request as this makes the problem immediately visible to everyone including malicious actors.

To report a security finding send to the following address:

    [christian@stateful.com](mailto:christian@stateful.com)

A member of the team will be immediately notified and will begin the triage process.
